# Agenda

Below is a suggested 90-minute agenda. Adjust timing based on your session length.

## 90-minute workshop

- **0:00–0:10** Welcome, goals, and warm-up with physical representations
- **0:10–0:35** Linear structures: arrays, stacks, queues
- **0:35–1:00** Linked lists and pointer reasoning
- **1:00–1:20** Trees and heaps
- **1:20–1:30** Graphs and hashing, wrap-up, and reflection

## Variations

- **60 minutes:** Focus on linear structures and linked lists only.
- **2 hours:** Add deeper tree/graph traversal and assessment design.
- **Half-day:** Add lesson planning and participant micro-teaching.
