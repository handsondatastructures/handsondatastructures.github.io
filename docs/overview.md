# Overview

**Hands On Data Structures: Making Abstraction Tangible with Manipulatives** is a workshop that helps educators make data structures concrete. Participants experience each structure as a physical system, then connect the model to diagrams and code.

## What makes this different

- **Embodied learning:** Participants use objects, movement, and spatial layouts to model abstract structures.
- **Multiple representations:** Physical models map to visuals, pseudocode, and classroom tasks.
- **Transfer-ready:** Activities are designed to be easy to scale for different grade bands.

## Structures covered

- Arrays and dynamic arrays
- Stacks and queues
- Linked lists
- Trees and heaps
- Graphs and traversal
- Hashing and collision strategies
