# Activities

Each activity is designed to be quick to set up and easy to run in small groups.

## Arrays and dynamic arrays

- **Human array:** Participants stand in numbered positions and exchange cards to model indexing and updates.
- **Resize moment:** Add new participants to show reallocation and copying costs.

## Stacks and queues

- **Stack of plates:** Use cups or cards to model push/pop and LIFO behavior.
- **Queue line:** Participants enqueue/dequeue to model FIFO and head/tail pointers.

## Linked lists

- **Yarn links:** Participants hold a card and connect with yarn to show next pointers.
- **Insertion challenge:** Add a new node and rewire links to highlight constant-time insertion.

## Trees and heaps

- **Human tree:** Participants arrange themselves into a binary tree and perform traversals.
- **Heap swaps:** Use numbered cards to model heapify and priority ordering.

## Graphs and hashing

- **Graph walk:** Tape nodes on the floor and navigate edges to model BFS/DFS.
- **Hash buckets:** Place cards into bins and simulate collisions with chains.
